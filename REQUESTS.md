Tsunam, a couple ideas for the Parser:
1) Special 'Total Procs' row. Would display the Average Proc DMG / Hit, Total Proc DMG, % of Total Proc DMG, and % of Base Proc DMG. (Sum of all procs)
2) Special 'Base Damage' row. Would display Average Base DMG / Hit, Total Base DMG, % of Total Base DMG. (Total minus Sum of all procs)
3) Additional '%Base DMG' column to the Total Damage, Total Procs, and Invidual Proc entries. (Similar to % DMG, but divided by 'Base Damage' amounts instead of 'Total Damage' amounts)
Doesn't really help out with data collection in here, but it would be neat to be able to see that info readily
